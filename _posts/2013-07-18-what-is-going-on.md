The metal/doom/punk label, Southern Lord, is on a tear.  Pickedup the new Baptists release yesterday and it smokes.  Great hardcore with post-punk twists. Cathartic.

The 405 expansion is going to kill traffic for the next few years.  Traffic is already bad in both directions in BOTH LA and Orange Counties.  No mention of public transportation options going along with this.  Sad.  Build more lanes and you will only get more traffic.  No bus lanes?  No light rail?  What gives?
